# tour-app
It's a project in progress. 
I'm practicing here mostly concepts of backend lie (API's, Routing, Authentications, DB, etc)

## Done so far:
- API (work in progress)
- Routing
- DB (work in progress)
- JWT (work in progress)
## Planned:
- API with express;
- DB: MongoDB by mongoose
- JWT implementation
- Payment gateway implementation
- File uploads (user pictures)
- Email confirmations
- Login, registration
- Render with React(probably)
